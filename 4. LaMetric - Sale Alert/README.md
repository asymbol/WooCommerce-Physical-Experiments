## LaMetric - Sale Alert #1

This experiment relies on the `LaMetric WooCommerce Sale Alert` [app](https://developer.lametric.com/applications/app/1424) being installed on the LaMetric device.

When a sale occurs, a WooCommerce 'order created' webhook notifies the middleware API's LaMetric endpoint, which makes a request to the LaMetric device with the sale amount.
